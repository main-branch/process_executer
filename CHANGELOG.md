## [4.0.0](https://github.com/main-branch/process_executer/compare/v3.2.4...v4.0.0) (2025-06-05)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Users who call ProcessExecuter::Options::Base#with even if from a derived class will need to update to use #merge instead.
* Users depending on `Result#stdout` or `Result#stderr` will either have to capture this output manually themselves or change from `spawn_and_wait`/`run` to `run_with_capture`.
* calls to `ProcessExecuter.spawn_with_timeout_with_options` and `ProcessExecuter.run_with_options` have been removed. Use `ProcessExecuter.spawn_with_timeout` and `ProcessExecuter.run` instead.
* Users who use ProcessExecuter.spawn_and_wait will need to update their calls to spawn_with_timeout. In addition, the following items will need to be updated if used by the user of this gem:
    * ProcessExecuter.spawn_and_wait_with_options
    * ProcessExecuter::SpawnAndWaitOptions
* In places where users of this gem rescued ::ArgumentError, they will have to change the rescued class to ProcessExecuter::ArgumentError.

### Features

* Add `ProcessExecuter.run_with_capture` ([d9e97fe](https://github.com/main-branch/process_executer/commit/d9e97fe7728a0c7fce9520ad5ba9568782243f70))
